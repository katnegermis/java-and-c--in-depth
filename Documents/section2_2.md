File system
=============

Structure
-----------
We decided to take a lot of inspiration from the FAT file system (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table), also naming our file system JCDFAT.

The smallest unit of allocation in JCDFAT is one block, which currently is 2^12 bytes (4KB).

The first block of the file system contains meta data (description below). Even though the meta data currently only is 28 bytes, it has a full block allocated to it, as described above.

The next block(s) contain(s) the File Allocation Table (FAT). Depending on how large the file system is, the FAT will span one or more blocks. Since we're using 32 bit integers, and blocks of size 4KB, each FAT block allows us to address 4MB.  This means that the smallest JCDFAT file system allowed is 4MB. It also means that the largest JCDFAT file system possible theoretically is 16 TB, but due to an implementation detail, it currently is 2 TB. The size of the FAT is _included_ in the size of the file system. The FAT takes up around 1/1024th of the file system; this means that if the file system is 16 TB, the FAT will be 16 GB.
There is no bound on the size of individual files, except the size of the file system.

The two blocks following the FAT are reserved for the root directory and the search file. The root directory is the root folder of the file system. The search file is the file in which we wish to store meta data for indexing the file system, allowing us to implement file search in milestone 2 of the project.

          (`|` represents a block boundary)

| Meta data | FAT block(s) | Root directory | Search file |
| data | data | data | data | data | data | data |  data  |
                        . . .
| data | data | data | data | data | data | data |  data  |



     Meta data
                          Size
+-----------------------+
| Magic number          | 4B
+-----------------------+
| Block size in         | 4B
| power-of-2 bytes      |
+-----------------------+
| Number of FAT blocks  | 4B
+-----------------------+
| Free blocks           | 4B
| (without expanding)   |
+-----------------------+
| First free block      | 4B
+-----------------------+
| Root directory block  | 4B
+-----------------------+
| Search file block     | 4B
+-----------------------+

Total size: 28 B



We use the structure called JCDDirEntry (described below) to represent files on disk. Each directory entry is 256KB, meaning that we can have 2^12/2^8 = 16 entries in each block. A folder, therefore, takes up at least 4 KB of space. In general, a folder takes up $ceil(entries / 16) * 2^12$ bytes.

Implementation
----------------

In the implementation of JCDFAT we've used the visitor pattern.




Implementation
----------------

1. The virtual disk must be stored in a single file in the working directory in the host file system.
    - Check
2. VFS must support the creation of a new disk with the specified maximum size at the specified location in the host file system.
    - Check
3. VFS must support several virtual disks in the host file system.
    - Check
4. VFS must support disposing of the virtual disk.
    - Check
5. VFS must support creating/deleting/renaming directories and files.
    - creating/renaming: Check
    - deleting?
6. VFS must support navigation: listing of files and folders, and going to a location expressed by a concrete path.
    - Check
7. VFS must support moving/copying directories and files, including hierarchy.
    - copying?
8. VFS must support importing files and directories from the host file system.
    - Check
9. VFS must support exporting files and directories to the host file system.
    - Check
10. VFS must support querying of free/occupied space in the virtual disk.
    - Not quite correct yet.

Bonus features
----------------
- Basic
    1. Compression implemented with third-party library. (1 point)
    2. Encryption implemented with third-party library. (1 point)
    3. Elastic disk: the virtual disk can dynamically grow or shrink, depending on its occupied space. (2 points)
        - Our virtual disk initially only takes up the space required by meta data, and hereafter expands itself when importing files. It does not, however, shrink when files are deleted.
- Advanced
    1. Compression implemented from scratch (you may use arithmetic compression 9 ). (2 points)
    2. Encryption implemented from scratch. (3 points)
    3. Large data: the VFS core can store and operate with an amount of data that doesnâ€™t a standard PC RAM (about 4 Gb). (3 points)
        - Check. Implemented by using buffers when reading/writing files.


Features that would be nice to have, but haven't been implemented:

- Don't decrease size of vfs when deleting
- Don't decrease size of folder when the number of entries in it decreases below a multiple of 16.
